	<p>Troll dolls are a popular toy that has been enjoyed by children and adults for many decades. Trolls are known for their brightly colored hair and unique appearance that makes them stand out. Plus they're great for decoration. They. Are. The. Best.</p>
	<h2>History of troll dolls</h2>
	<p>Troll dolls were first created in the 1950s by a Danish woodcarver named Thomas Dam. He made the dolls as a gift for his daughter and soon began selling them to local shops. In the 1960s, the dolls became popular in the United States and other countries, and were sold by the millions.</p>

	<p>Troll dolls have become a popular item for collectors. Some collectors look for rare or vintage troll dolls, while others collect a specific type of troll doll, such as those with a certain color of hair or outfit. Many collectors also enjoy customizing their troll dolls with new outfits or hairstyles. I always look for the troll dolls with jems in their bellybuttons because those are the hardest to find!</p>
	<h2>Pop culture references</h2>
	<p>Troll dolls have appeared in many movies, TV shows, and other media over the years. Some notable examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The 1992 movie "Toy Soldiers," which featured troll dolls as a key plot point</li>
		<li>The 1993 movie "Demolition Man," in which Sylvester Stallone's character has a collection of troll dolls</li>
		<li>The 2016 movie "Trolls," which was based on the popular toy line and featured a variety of troll characters. This movie looks like it sucks though. LOL</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Where to buy troll dolls</h2>
	<p>Troll dolls are still sold today and can be found at many toy stores, gift shops, and online retailers. (But those are the ugly new ones). If you're looking for the actual troll dolls you can find them at flea markets, antique shops, value village and other places that sell vintage or collectible items.</p>
